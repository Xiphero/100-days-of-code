# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 30, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page. Signed up for 100 days of code. Need to remember to sign up for the Chingu Cohorts once I've learned enough to actually contribute.

**Thoughts:** I started out mostly trying to figure out the new bootstrap documentation vs what the example gave me. I feel I could have been more creative with the site or more efficient. I'll ask about it in the gitter chat.
