# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page. Signed up for 100 days of code. Refreshed jQuery knowledge on FCC as I was uselessly rusty on it.

**Thoughts:** I started out mostly trying to figure out the new bootstrap documentation vs what the example gave me. I feel I could have been more creative with the page or more efficient. I'll ask about it in the gitter chat.  Need to remember to sign up for the Chingu Cohorts once I've learned enough to actually contribute.

### Day 1, January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Almost Finished FreeCodeCamp Javascript Tutorials. Completed about 70 excercises in the category before burning out. Will likely have to review the last 5 or so. 

**Thoughts:** I really feel like I could be doing more, but I'm managing to pull my attention to where it neads to be more often than I was previously, so I'm glad to be making progress on that front.

### Day 2, January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Basic Javascript tutorials on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  The five or so trials before the last dozen-ish were fairly difficult to complete with my inexperience at the time, but I was at least able to come close to a proper answer before needing assistance. Will redo the exercises later on to complete them with only my newfound knowledge. Somewhat dissapointed in myself. I feel as if I definitely could have accomplished more, but not too upset. Rather proud at myself for how much I accomplished yesterday, so perhaps I tricked myself into resting on my laurels.
