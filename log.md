# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page. Signed up for 100 days of code. Refreshed jQuery knowledge on FCC as I was uselessly rusty on it.

**Thoughts:** I started out mostly trying to figure out the new bootstrap documentation vs what the example gave me. I feel I could have been more creative with the page or more efficient. I'll ask about it in the gitter chat.  Need to remember to sign up for the Chingu Cohorts once I've learned enough to actually contribute.

### Day 1, January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp Javascript Tutorials. 

**Thoughts:** I really feel like I could be doing more, but I'm managing to pull my attention to where it neads to be more often than I was previously, so I'm glad to be making progress on that front.
